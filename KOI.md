Identifiers (Just Names/Labels)

- kepid → Like a roll number for each star.

- kepoi_name → Temporary nickname for a possible planet (“KOI = Kepler Object of Interest”).

- kepler_name → The official name if it turns out to be a real exoplanet.

✅ Labels (The Truth NASA Decided Later)

- koi_disposition → The final verdict:

- Confirmed = Yes, it’s a real planet.

- False Positive = Nope, it was something else (like star noise or instrument error).

- Candidate = Not sure yet.

- koi_pdisposition → An earlier “first guess” made by the telescope’s computer pipeline before humans double-checked.

- koi_score → A number between 0 and 1, showing how likely it is to be a real planet (higher = more likely).

🚩 False Positive Flags (Red Alerts that it might not be a planet)

These are like warning lights 🚨 telling scientists why something might not be a planet. Examples:

- koi_fpflag_nt → Looks like noise, not a planet.

- koi_fpflag_ss → Looks like it came from another star nearby, not this one.

- koi_fpflag_co → Could be caused by contamination (light blending).

- koi_fpflag_ec → Might be caused by an eclipsing binary star (two stars blocking each other).
