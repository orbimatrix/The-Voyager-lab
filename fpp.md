- fpp_koi_period → How long it takes the planet to orbit its star (days).

- fpp_prad → Planet size compared to Earth (radius in Earth units).

- fpp_ror → Ratio of planet size to its star’s size.

- fpp_steff → Temperature of the star (Kelvin, hotter = bluer).

- fpp_srad → Radius of the star (in Sun radii).

- fpp_smass → Mass of the star (in Sun masses).

- fpp_sage → Age of the star (in billions of years).

- fpp_dist → Distance of the star from Earth (in parsecs; 1 pc ≈ 3.26 light years).

- fpp_av → Extinction (how much dust dims the starlight).

- fpp_score → A summary score: how well this object matches being a planet vs. a false positive.

- fpp_spec_occrate → How often planets like this exist, based on statistics.

- fpp_secthresh → The max brightness dip allowed if it were a secondary eclipse (like a star hiding another star).

- fpp_maxrad → The max distance on the sky where a false signal could come from (arcseconds = tiny angle).

- fpp_prob → Overall probability it’s a false alarm.

- fpp_prob_heb → Probability it’s a “Hierarchical Eclipsing Binary” (a star orbiting another star, within the same system).

- fpp_prob_ueb → Probability it’s an “Unblended Eclipsing Binary” (two stars blocking each other, no blending).

- fpp_prob_beb → Probability it’s a “Blended Eclipsing Binary” (two stars blended together look like one).

- fpp_prob_heb_dbl, ueb_dbl, beb_dbl → Same as above, but with “double period” cases (more complex star-star interactions).
