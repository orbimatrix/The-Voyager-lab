## Column Explanation

Each row = one star observed by Kepler.
Important columns:

- kepid → Unique ID of the star in the Kepler catalog.

- ra, dec → Position of the star in the sky (Right Ascension, Declination).

- kepmag → Brightness of the star in Kepler’s filter (lower = brighter).

- teff → Effective temperature of the star’s surface (in Kelvin).

e.g. Sun = ~5778 K.

- logg → Stellar surface gravity (higher = denser/smaller star).

- feh → Metallicity (ratio of iron to hydrogen vs. the Sun, in dex).

- Positive → star has more heavy elements than Sun.

- radius → Radius of the star (in Solar radii).

- mass → Mass of the star (in Solar masses).

- dens → Density of the star.

- nconfp → Number of confirmed planets found around this star.

- nkoi → Number of candidate planets (KOIs) around this star.

- ntce → Number of detected transit events (TCEs).

- st_vet_date → Last update date.
